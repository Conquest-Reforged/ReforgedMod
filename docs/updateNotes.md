# Update Notes

When updating the mod to a new version (eg: 1.16-1.17), and if there is difficulty getting 
"Add dependency on module" to actually do something, go to "Project Structure" and add the proper
dependency to the modules "Main" folder rather than the module folder itself (ie: ReforgedContent/main)
